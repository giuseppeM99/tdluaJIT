# tdluaJIT
Pure lua TD wrapper using LuaJIT
see testtd.lua

## semi-async update loop
**EXPERIMENTAL**
see testloop.lua

## usage
tdlua.lua is the main script
it has *almost* the same functions of [tdlua](https://github.com/giuseppeM99/tdlua) but in a pure LuaJIT fashion
this means that you just need to `require 'tdlua'` to use it.
